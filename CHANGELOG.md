## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A folder in the sidebar now has a right-click menu, and its first action is "mark all as read" for that folder alone. The account row could already clear a whole mailbox, but a mailbox is not how anyone reads: the mail waiting to be dealt with is in one folder, and clearing the other five to reach it is not an option. The action is scoped to the folder's own unread count, so the number it clears is the number that folder row shows, and it carries that count beside it so the press is a decision rather than a leap. It is disabled at zero rather than hidden, because an action that disappears is one nobody learns exists. A row under the combined mailbox expands the way the message list already does — "mark all as read" on `all:inbox` clears every account's inbox in one command and reports one total, instead of looping in the UI and reporting a partial sum. That scope needed its own backend command (`mark_folder_all_read`), because the existing `mark_account_all_read` resolves its targets from a mailbox-wide query and cannot be narrowed; the two now share the entire write path — the bulk Gmail `messages.batchModify`, the per-mailbox `UID STORE` fan-out, the queued retry for a provider that cannot be reached — so a fix to one cannot miss the other. The folder scope is deliberately *weaker* than the mailbox one: a mailbox's unread count drops anything filed only under drafts, trash or spam, but a folder's own count does not, and applying the mailbox predicate to a folder would leave "mark all as read" with nothing to clear in the trash — the one folder where the count is most visible. The list is role-aware: Trash offers "Empty Trash" and Spam offers "Empty Spam", both behind a confirmation because unlike marking read they cannot be undone, and both reaching the provider's permanent delete; a custom folder offers neither. Every folder also offers "Sync this folder", which is the answer to a folder that looks stale. Renaming and deleting a folder are absent on purpose — no layer below the UI supports them. The menu is drawn through a portal onto `document.body`: the sidebar sets `overflow: hidden` to fold its rows away and the app shell opens a stacking context, so a menu rendered inside the row would be clipped at the panel's edge and would sort under the message list. It flips back inside the window when the press lands near an edge, which is exactly where the last folder in a long list sits, focuses its first *enabled* row so the arrows never land on a dead one, and closes on Escape through the same overlay marker the app's other popovers use — so the keystroke that dismisses the menu does not also close the message behind it.
- The sidebar can now be folded away from the sidebar itself. Collapsing was reachable only from the command palette, so the one control that hides the rail was also the one thing you could not find inside it, and once folded there was no way back without opening the palette again. A row at the foot of the rail now carries the action, labelled by what the press will do — "Collapse sidebar" / "Expand sidebar" — rather than by the state it is in, so its accessible name stays a usable instruction at both widths. The collapsed rail also grew from 48px to 60px: at 48 the account avatars had to shrink to fit and their unread badges hung over the edge of the row, and the extra 12px is what lets a 30px avatar carry a count without touching the panel's border. Folders with mail waiting show a dot on their icon while the rail is folded, where the trailing count column no longer exists.
- The message detail view can now be read through one of eight theme templates, switchable from a palette action in the message header or from Settings › Appearance. The reading pane had one fixed layout — the same canvas, the same header, no card around the body — which gave a two-line reply and a long newsletter identical visual weight and made the screen hard to scan. Each template now decides a palette *and* an arrangement, in two families. The neutral four defer to the app's own tokens: **Card**, the default and the closest to the previous rendering, centres a 760px reading column built from a header card and a body card; **Mailbox** drops the cards for a full-bleed rule, denser type and the actions on the sender's own line; **Letter** sets the mail on warm paper with a circular monogram above a centred serif subject and a wider line height; **Console** splits the pane in two, with the sender, actions and attachments in a dark rail beside the message on a white sheet. Four further templates are brand skins, modelled on a reading surface people already know because a familiar shape is faster to navigate than a novel one, and each owning its colours outright so that it looks the same in either app theme: **Claude** (ivory page, centred column, serif subject, muted terracotta), **WeChat** (flat grey, square white cards, the largest body type, green for actions and slate blue for links), **Telegram** (a full-width white header band over a single column, the actions under the message, one blue throughout) and **iMessage** (very round white cards on iOS system grey behind a neutral monogram). Two axes rather than one is the point: recolouring alone left every template looking like the same screen, and brand skins differ in roundness and type as much as in colour, so a skin may deliberately share an arrangement with a neutral template — WeChat is Mailbox in different clothes — while a test still refuses any template that differs from an existing one by palette alone. A template is plain data in `src/lib/messageThemes.ts` — palette, type scale and layout measurements, nothing else — published as `--msg-*` custom properties plus a handful of `data-msg-*` structural flags on the detail root, with the arrangements themselves in `src/styles/index.css`; components read the variables and never branch on a template id, so a ninth template is one more registry entry. Where a brand's two colour roles disagree they are kept apart: the action accent is its own field, separate from the link colour. A brand with a display face of its own also lends it to the sender's own unstyled headings, so Claude's serif reaches the mail's `<h1>` — while a heading the sender explicitly styled keeps its font. The picker's thumbnails are drawn from each template's own data — page colour, header treatment, column width, card roundness and whether the monogram is round — rather than from a fixed set of shapes, because eight templates do not fit four shapes and the brand skins are told apart by roundness as much as by arrangement. `--msg-divider` now carries a whole border shorthand rather than a colour, which is how the sidebar and the attachment bar were already trying to consume it: `border-top: 1px solid var(--msg-divider)` expanded to `1px solid 1px solid …` and quietly dropped the rule. The choice is remembered across messages and sessions, and Card stays the default.
- The model field on the AI and translation settings is now a dropdown of known names — a short list of common OpenAI-compatible models, plus whatever the endpoint itself reports — with a "Custom…" entry that reveals a text box for anything the list does not know. A dropdown alone cannot serve here, because the set of models is a property of whatever endpoint has been typed, so no built-in list can be complete, while a bare text box asks people to recall exact identifiers. A "Fetch models" button reads `GET {base}/v1/models` and merges the answer into the list, tolerating the shapes providers actually return and remembering the result per endpoint for the session. A saved name the list has never heard of opens straight into the text box instead of blanking the field. Engines with no list to read — the assistant's Generic provider, and DeepL, DeepLX and the generic translate API — keep manual entry and are not offered the button.
- Added an AI assistant alongside the translation engine, with its own settings tab. On the message screen a ✨ header action (`Ctrl+Shift+S`) summarises the open mail into a collapsible panel above the body; on the compose screen polish, proofread, translate and help-write run against the draft, and the result is reviewed side by side with the original before it replaces the text, is inserted below it, or is copied — nothing is written into the editor unreviewed. The assistant keeps its own provider configuration (`ai_config`, its own encryption purpose, its own `ai_*` commands), so pointing it at a different service cannot disturb translation and vice versa; the sharing runs one way, in that the assistant reuses the translation module's HTTP client and its OpenAI-compatible wire-format helpers. The compose translate action prefers the assistant whenever one is configured, and falls back to the translation engine only when none is — a *failing* AI call is reported rather than quietly downgraded, because answering with a different engine changes the output without saying so.
- Added an unread-mail badge on the app icon, showing the combined unread count across every account. It covers the Dock on macOS, the launcher on Linux, and a taskbar overlay badge on Windows, and it is refreshed from the local store so the number stays correct while the window is hidden in the tray.
- Added a one-click "mark all as read" action for each account, on the selected row of the sidebar account list and on every account row in Settings. It clears the whole mailbox locally and on the provider in bulk, using `messages.batchModify` on Gmail and `UID STORE` on IMAP, and falls back to per-message updates where the provider offers no bulk API. Writes that cannot reach the provider are queued and retried, matching the existing pending-operation behaviour.
- Added iCloud Mail as a one-click setup preset (`imap.mail.me.com:993` over TLS, `smtp.mail.me.com:587` over STARTTLS). iCloud does not offer third-party OAuth, so the setup form shows an inline hint explaining that an app-specific password from appleid.apple.com is required instead of the normal account password.
- Every row in the combined inbox now names the mailbox it came from. A colour bar on its own asks the reader to memorise a legend, which stops working somewhere around the second or third account; rows now carry a small badge showing the account's colour and its name, with the full address kept in the tooltip. It appears in both list styles — messages and threads — and only in the combined inbox, since that is the one view that actually mixes mailboxes. Threads had no account marking at all before this, so `ThreadSummary` now reports the `account_id` of the thread's newest message and the store attributes a thread that spans two mailboxes to whichever one spoke last.

- Escape now closes the message you have open before it does anything else. The key is bound to `close-modal`, and with nothing modal on screen it went straight for the view: from search it returned you to the inbox and left the open message behind, which is the opposite of backing out of what you were reading. Escape now walks the layers one at a time — an open popover closes itself, then the message, and only then the view. The views do not keep their selection in one place (the inbox holds it in the store, search and starred in component state), so the shortcut layer asks through a cancelable event rather than reaching into any of them, and an unanswered request is how it learns to fall through to the next layer instead of swallowing the press. Popovers now carry a marker while they are open, so the popover that closes on a press is not the same press that closes the message underneath it.

- Each of the four brand-skin templates now has a night of its own, so dark mode is no longer a light pane sitting in a dark app. The eight templates split in two here: the neutral pair publish the app's own colour properties and have always followed dark mode, but a brand skin owns its colours outright — that is what makes it a brand — and the colours it publishes are literals, so there is no declaration for a `[data-theme="dark"]` rule to override. The mode is therefore read as a value and the template resolved before anything consumes it (`resolveMessageTheme`), behind a hook that also listens to the OS preference so a system switch arrives without a remount; the alternative, letting brand skins follow the app's tokens, would have stopped them being brands. Each answers with its own night rather than the app's — WeChat's dark grey and Telegram's night blue are theirs — Letter and Claude keep the ivory paper their mail is typed on and darken only the desk around it, and the three chat skins park sanitized mail on a white sheet, because mail is authored for light. Console needs no night palette: it is already dark. The picker's thumbnails move with them, so a brand is previewed as the pane it will really paint. The night palettes were chosen against measured contrast rather than by eye, and a test now computes the WCAG ratio for every text-on-background pair the stylesheet actually paints — resolving the header to the page when it draws no band, and mail to its sheet — holding dark mode to the same floors as light and refusing a night palette that trades away more than a quarter of the contrast its day palette had. WeChat's night monogram was lifted from its day slate blue on the strength of that number alone: 3.87:1 under a chip that read 4.27:1 by day.

- Pebble now reopens where it was last left, at the size it was left at — maximized or fullscreen too, if that is how it was closed. Every launch used to place the window at the 1200×800 centred position written in the configuration, so anyone working with a second display moved it back into place at the start of every session, and the cost fell on exactly the people with the most reason to move it. The geometry is written beside the rest of the profile half a second after the window stops moving rather than once per frame of a drag, and written once more as the app quits, because a settle delay is the right trade while the app is running and the wrong one on the way out. Restoring it blindly would have been worse than not remembering it at all: a position only means anything relative to a display that was attached at the time, and an external monitor drops out on its own, so a remembered place that no longer overlaps any attached display is discarded and the centred default stands. The test is not "does the rectangle overlap a display" but "is there enough of the window on one to take hold of" — a window two pixels inside the edge technically overlaps the display and is still lost to a person. A remembered geometry that cannot be parsed, or that describes no window, is ignored rather than repaired: a settings file should not be able to stop the app from opening.

- Accounts can now be arranged in the order you want them, one step at a time with the arrows on each row of Settings › Accounts. The list used to be whatever `created_at` said and nothing else, so a mailbox someone opens first sat below one they barely read, with no way to say otherwise. The arrows save the whole list in a single write instead of moving one row: a per-account "move" would have to renumber its neighbours itself, and two of those arriving out of order would leave two accounts claiming the same position. The list is read as a preference rather than a contract, so a settings panel that went stale — an account added or removed in another window — still saves instead of failing the click, and anything the list does not mention keeps its relative place behind the accounts it does. The order is not only cosmetic: the first account is the address a new message is sent from while the combined mailbox is selected, so the arrows are how that default is chosen, and new accounts join the end rather than the front. The upgrade stamps every account's position from the `created_at` order it already had, so no existing list reshuffles and no existing default sender changes. A settings backup carries the order with it, because the accounts array is written in display order and a restore re-applies it — which also keeps a partial backup from leaving restored accounts tied with the local ones the file never mentioned. In the sidebar the same order is set by dragging a row, which is the gesture the list invites: the whole row is the handle rather than a grip, because the list is short and the label is the obvious thing to grab. That row is also the button that opens the mailbox, so the two gestures share one press — a drag is only recognised once the pointer has travelled five pixels, and dnd-kit swallows the click that trails a release, so a row that was moved is not also selected on the way. Dragging is pointer-only; the wrapper would have to become a second button for dnd-kit's keyboard sensor, and the arrows already give the keyboard the same control.

### Changed

- The sidebar is now a list of mailboxes with their folders nested under each, the shape macOS Mail uses. It had stacked an account picker on top of one flat folder list, so the column read as two lists rather than one, and because every account's folders were merged into a single run of rows, a folder's mailbox became impossible to name once two accounts shared a folder name — two Inboxes, two Sent, two Trash, with nothing to say which belonged to whom. Each mailbox is now a group with a disclosure triangle: the triangle folds it, the row beside it opens it, so the two gestures that were competing for one press get their own targets. Groups open on a fresh install and the ones you fold are remembered by account id, stored as the list of closed ones rather than a flag per mailbox, so an account added later starts open instead of inheriting a default of closed. The triangles are drawn only for a mailbox that has folders to fold, and a spacer holds the column when there are none, so a mailbox whose first sync has not finished still lines its avatar up with the rest. The mailbox name and its folders share one left edge and one trailing count column: measured in the browser rather than assumed, a 26px avatar ends at x=59 and a 16px folder icon at x=54, which is why the row's gap is the 5px that lands both labels on 64, and the account row carries the same 8px trailing inset a folder row spends from its own padding so every unread pill ends on the same pixel. Folded away, the rail drops the gutters and the stable scrollbar gutter, which is what puts all of its icons back on one centre line. The combined mailbox becomes a group like any other, listing the roles every account contributes and totalling their unread mail, and it now shows only those roles: a custom folder belongs to exactly one mailbox and is already listed under it, so repeating it would draw the same destination twice and opening it from there would have to guess which mailbox was meant. Starred and Snoozed belong to no mailbox, so they sit above the groups the way macOS keeps its favorites above the accounts — and they stay in the folded rail, where their icons are still the only way to reach them. The folder list is also now the only part of the rail that scrolls, so the search field and the tools stay put under a long list of folders.
- The sidebar's unread counts are on by default. They were behind "Show unread count badges in sidebar" in Settings › General, and that checkbox started off — so a fresh install showed no counts anywhere in the sidebar, and the one place that says which mailbox has mail waiting looked exactly like the one that says nothing has arrived. A preference that starts off is indistinguishable from a feature that does not work, which is how it read. Only a stored `"false"` turns the counts off now, so an existing opt-out is honoured and the checkbox still works; what changed is the answer for someone who has never opened Settings. The reader defaults to visible rather than the store reading a bare `=== "true"`, because that comparison made every other value — including the `null` of a key that was never written — mean "off", which is the shape that hid this in the first place.
- The unread rows in the message and thread lists are marked by more than one cue, and by stronger ones. A single 6px dot next to the sender's name was the whole of it, and that dot was also drawn *after* the name — so it trailed whatever width each name happened to measure and no two rows lined up, and against a row that already carried a colour bar and a mailbox badge in the combined inbox it read as one more piece of metadata. Three things now say the same thing at once: a wash of the accent colour across the row, a marker in the left gutter, and type that keeps its full strength while read mail steps back to the secondary colour. The marker is absolutely positioned into the row's own 14px padding rather than laid out in it, so it costs no reflow — the sender, subject and snippet keep one left edge whether a row is unread or not — and pinned to the first line rather than centred on the row, so the markers form a column at a fixed x down the list. The date of an unread row turns accent and semibold as well, which is the cue that survives a row whose sender and subject are long enough to fill the line. Read mail receding is the half that makes a list scannable rather than readable one row at a time, and it is why the wash is no longer asked to carry the signal alone. Hover deepens the wash instead of replacing it with the neutral `--color-bg-hover`, so an unread row stays visibly unread under the pointer, and dark mode answers the tint with its own mix rather than reusing the light one, which was too faint to see against `#141414`. The thread list gains a count beside the participant as well — a thread can hold a dozen unread and a dot cannot say how many, and whether opening it is worth the interruption is the question a thread row is being asked.

- The sidebar's rows were rebuilt on one visual system. Folders, tools and mailboxes had each grown their own metrics — three different horizontal paddings, two font sizes and two row heights — so the icons did not sit on a shared left edge and the column read as three lists stacked rather than one. Every destination now wears the same row (`.sidebar-row`): one height, one padding, one icon size, with hover, selection and keyboard focus expressed in the stylesheet instead of in per-element `onMouseEnter` handlers that also left the keyboard with no focus ring at all. The selected row is marked by its icon turning accent rather than by a second background colour, which keeps it in step with the selected row in the message list — both still paint `--color-sidebar-active`. Icons rest at the secondary text colour so the labels lead and only the current view is coloured. Unread counts are now pills in a fixed 30px column at the trailing edge: reserved whether or not it holds a number, so mail arriving never re-flows the label beside it, and the account counts and folder counts finally line up in one column instead of the accounts floating theirs over an avatar. Three digits are allowed to spill into the row's own padding rather than being capped, because a combined mailbox really does reach 143. Account monograms are tinted with the colour that account already carries in the message list, mixed with transparent so a wallpaper still reads through, and handed out by `assignAccountColors` so two mailboxes never share one. The search row is drawn as a field with the key that focuses it, read from the user's own bindings rather than hard-coded. Over a wallpaper the selection and hover fills are mixed translucent, since the panel itself already is and an opaque fill punched a solid hole in it.

- The unread count rides the avatar again only while the sidebar is collapsed. The earlier change moved it there from the trailing edge because a bare accent number at the far end of the row read as one more control next to the mark-all-read action and vanished entirely when the rail was folded. Both of those reasons are answered differently now: the count is a pill in a reserved column rather than loose text, so it cannot be mistaken for a control and cannot displace the address, and the collapsed rail keeps the avatar badge, capped at `9+` because three digits do not fit a 30px avatar. The row still states its count exactly once at either width, and the full number stays in the tooltip and in the accessible name.

- A folder row in the sidebar now shows the folder's own name rather than the path the provider stored it under. A nested folder arrives as one string — IMAP joins the levels with the server's own delimiter (`Work/Reports`), Gmail keeps whatever slashes a label's owner typed, and `[Gmail]/All Mail` is the same shape — and the row printed the whole thing, so the label was spent on levels the reader never asked about and a long path was ellipsised to the part that names the folder least. The row is one line and answers "which folder is this": the segment after the last separator is what names it, while the mailbox above it is already named on its group, and the sidebar draws no tree for the levels in between to belong to. The full path is not discarded — it is what the row now offers as its tooltip, and it is still what the folder is stored, synced and looked up by, so the settings list of folders to sync and every backend lookup keep addressing the folder exactly as before. The folder's own right-click menu follows the same rule, so it no longer announces "Work/Reports actions" for the row a reader knows as Reports. A name with no separator in it is untouched, and a name that is nothing but separators is returned as it was rather than as an empty row.
- In the bilingual view, a translated paragraph now carries the sentence it came from directly underneath it. Reading a translation and its source side by side is the reason to open this view at all, and the layout previously discarded the source the moment it replaced it — the only copy left was in the reader's memory. Fragments under sixteen characters keep their translation without the echo, because mirroring every button label and link caption drowns a newsletter in duplicated text, and the strip carries no style of its own: its appearance comes from the shadow root's stylesheet, because anything inline is refused by the app's content security policy.
- Each account's unread count now rides on its avatar, as a small badge on the corner, instead of a number at the far end of its row. The trailing number was read as one more control sitting next to the mark-all-read action, and it disappeared entirely when the sidebar was collapsed — which is exactly when a mailbox's state is hardest to read any other way. The count is now attached to the mailbox it belongs to at both widths, the row states it once rather than twice, and anything above 99 reads as `99+` so the badge keeps a single width.
- The sidebar account picker is now a list instead of a dropdown: every mailbox is visible at once with its own unread count, so accounts can be told apart and switched between at a glance rather than one at a time. Accounts with a custom label show the label and its address on separate lines; the mark-all-read action now rides on the selected row and stays absent for the combined view, where it has no single target. Collapsed sidebars show one initial per account instead of no picker at all.
- An account's name is shown on message rows, so the setting is now called 账户昵称 in Chinese rather than 账户备注 and its help text says where the value appears. Without a name, rows show the part of the address before `@` — `work@example.com` reads as `work` — unless two mailboxes share that part, in which case the full address is used, because that is the only thing that still tells them apart.

### Fixed

- The theme picker's thumbnails for the two templates that follow the app's colours now follow them in dark mode as well. A thumbnail is drawn from a small snapshot palette rather than from the live styles, and for Card and Mailbox that snapshot is the light one — so the picker advertised a light reading pane for exactly the two templates that re-colour themselves, showing the default (Card) as a white miniature next to a message that renders dark. Those thumbnails now take their page, card and text colours from the tokens the template actually paints with. The hairline a thumbnail draws around a card comes from the app's border token instead of a faded text colour in the same change, because a token cannot take the two-hex-digit alpha suffix a literal colour can, and pasting one on would have dropped the rule without saying so.
- A message is no longer laid out with styles that the app's own content security policy refuses. Handing the shadow root its stylesheet as an adopted sheet fixed the rules the app writes, but the mail's *own* `style` attributes were still inline content — and `style-src-attr`, which has no value of its own, inherits the nonce-bearing `'unsafe-inline'` of `style-src` and therefore refuses every one of them. The webview keeps the attribute text and merely declines to apply it, so the failure does not look like an unstyled message: it looks like a *mis-laid-out* one. A Pinterest breakdown arrived as the case that names its own cause — the white label that the desktop path hides with `display:none` was painted above each tile, and the same refusal took its `color:#ffffff` away, so it fell back to the shadow root's `a { color: var(--color-accent) }` and came out terracotta. Every size, padding and colour went the same way. On top of that the whitelist that decides which declarations may survive was dropping `table-layout`, `background-size`, `object-fit` and `box-sizing` — the four an email grid is built from — so the thumbnails painted at their intrinsic size instead of covering their cells. The surviving declarations are now read back off the attribute and written through `CSSStyleDeclaration.setProperty`, a CSSOM write that no directive covers, and those four properties are allowed through. The attribute itself stays put, because the shadow stylesheet matches on it (`table[style*="height:100%"]`).
- The original text under a translated paragraph is now printed once per paragraph, after the whole paragraph, instead of after every fragment of it. The bilingual view pairs a translated paragraph with the sentence it came from, but it decided what a paragraph was by looking at the text nodes the sanitizer produced — and a sentence containing bold or linked words is not one text node. A read.ai newsletter turned a single sentence into seven of them, and produced eleven "original" lines across one message: the English landed in the middle of the sentence, once per fragment, leaving the translation and the source interleaved on the same line — which is the opposite of what the feature is for. The echo is now keyed on the nearest block-level ancestor, appended after everything the engine rewrote and inside no inline element of the sender's, and it carries that paragraph's whole original wording rather than one fragment's. A paragraph short enough to be a label rather than prose is still left alone.

- The styles a message is rendered with now actually reach it. The shadow root that holds a sanitized mail is styled by a stylesheet this app writes into it, and it was written as a `<style>` element — inline content. Tauri appends a nonce to the `style-src` of its content security policy, and under CSP the presence of a nonce makes `'unsafe-inline'` count for nothing, so the webview refused the element and everything it carried went with it: the mail's own sizing (`img { max-width: 100% }`, the placeholder drawn for a blocked image, `pre` line wrapping) and the muted line the bilingual view prints under a translated paragraph. The last of those was visible as the original running on from the translation in the surrounding body colour, which is what made the bilingual view look as though it had no separator at all — and no amount of restyling the strip could repair it, because the rule was never applied in the first place. The stylesheet is now handed over as a constructable stylesheet through `adoptedStyleSheets`, which is not inline content and is covered by no directive, with the `<style>` element kept only as the fallback for engines that have no constructable stylesheets. The old code renders correctly in jsdom, in Chromium and in a standalone WKWebView, which is why the failure was invisible from a test and had to be read out of the running app.

- An IMAP session that the server ended because the access token expired now reconnects with a freshly exchanged token instead of reporting the failure and staying dead. Microsoft's IMAP answers `BYE ... Session invalidated - AccessTokenExpired` when the token a session was opened with runs out, and every command on that session fails the same way afterwards; the wording matched none of the transport-level patterns the reconnect check looks for, so the failure took the catch-all branch, which only reports it. The check now recognises the verdict, and a reconnect that follows it forces the token exchange rather than trusting the locally recorded expiry — which is precisely the record the server just contradicted, since `ensure_fresh_xoauth2` skipped its work while `expires_at` still looked valid and the retry therefore presented the same rejected token. Mail used to stall for as long as that local estimate stayed wrong, and in the meantime the account looked connected. All seven connect paths go through the expiry-aware connect, including the idle watcher, where a long-lived session most often dies of exactly this. A rejected token exchange is still reported as its own kind of failure rather than being mistaken for an expired session.

- An IMAP account signed in with XOAUTH2 can now be repointed at a different tenant without re-obtaining its refresh token, and the settings panel states which tenant the next refresh will use. The tenant, client ID and refresh token are read back from the account and prefilled, so saving no longer overwrites a stored directory ID with the `common` default that the form started from — which is exactly how an account configured for a single-tenant app registration regresses to the endpoint Microsoft refuses with `AADSTS50194`. A blank refresh token or client secret now means "keep the stored one" instead of failing or erasing it, and that is the only way a tenant can be corrected, since the refresh token is the one value a person cannot retype from memory. A verified token also requests a sync immediately, because the worker for a mailbox that has been failing is long finished and would otherwise sit idle until the next launch. When Entra does reject a refresh, the error now says which field to change for the codes that have one — `AADSTS50194` points at the tenant, `700016` at the tenant or client ID, `7000215`/`7000218` at the client secret, `70008` at an expired token — because the AADSTS text names a symptom and never the setting.

- A new-mail notification no longer costs a processor core for the rest of the session. Pebble raises the notification through `mac-notification-sys` and asks it to wait for a click, so that clicking the banner opens the message; inside the library that wait was a `while (keepRunning) { [runLoop runUntilDate:+0.1s] }` loop, and a run loop with no input sources returns from `runUntilDate:` immediately, which turned the wait into a spin. `keepRunning` is cleared only by clicking the notification or its close button — and a banner that was glanced at and ignored clears neither, which is the ordinary case, since macOS withdraws a banner on its own after a few seconds. The loop therefore ran until the process exited: one thread at a full core per notification, accumulating for as long as Pebble stayed open. Seven ignored notifications measured 675% CPU and thirteen processor-hours of work. The dependency is now 0.6.15, where the same wait blocks on a condition variable and a poll on the main run loop notices a banner that disappears by itself, so the thread ends when the notification does. Clicking a notification still opens the message.
- Resizing the window from its edges and corners no longer brings another application to the front on macOS 26 (Tahoe). AppKit starts a window resize from a 19×19 hit area at each corner, and Tahoe's larger corner radius pushed most of that area outside the window, so a press inside the window misses the resize region and falls through to whatever window is behind it — which the system then raises, making a corner drag look like it switches apps. The behaviour cannot be repaired from the app side, and Tauri's `startResizeDragging` is unimplemented on macOS, so the app now draws its own resize grips — four edges, four corners, with the top-left one narrowed to clear the traffic lights — and resizes by setting the window's size and position itself. They are only mounted on macOS, where the native path is broken; elsewhere the native frame handles resizing as before.
- The sidebar's unread badge now updates as soon as mail is delivered. Delivery raised `mail:new`, whose handler refreshed the message list, the thread list and the per-folder counts, but not the per-account counts the badge on each account's avatar reads (`account-unread-counts`). The only other path that invalidates that key is a read-state change, so the badge sat on its previous number until the reader opened the mail — showing, at last, a count it should have shown minutes earlier — with the 30-second poll as the sole fallback, and that poll does not run while the window is unfocused. The delivery handler and the generic refresh path now invalidate the key alongside the others.
- Bilingual translation now translates into the reader's language rather than into its opposite. Both the bilingual view and the selection translator chose their target as "whatever the interface is not" — English for a Chinese interface, Chinese otherwise — so an English message opened by a reader whose interface was English was sent to the engine with English as the target and came back unchanged; the unchanged text was then drawn as the translation, which is why the feature looked like it did nothing. The target is now the interface language, the one language the reader is known to want, and the value the rest of the app already switches through. A translation that returns empty, absent, or byte-identical to its source now reports an error instead of being rendered, because a paragraph the engine declined to answer must never be shown as though it had been. The selection popover keeps its own language picker, which now defaults to the reader's language and remembers the last choice.
- An OpenAI-compatible endpoint can now be written either as a bare host or with a trailing `/v1`. The settings fields offer `https://api.openai.com/v1` as their example, but the request URL was built by appending `/v1/chat/completions` unconditionally, so anyone following the example sent their traffic to `/v1/v1/chat/completions` and got a 404. Both spellings now resolve to the same URL, and the model list and the calls that follow it are built from the same base.
- Selecting a mailbox in the sidebar now leaves the Settings and Contacts screens for the mail view. Those two screens show nothing about a particular mailbox, so the click previously changed the selection invisibly and looked like it had been ignored.
- Fixed mailboxes with no folders being impossible to select. The sidebar used to advance to the next account whenever the selected one had no folders, which with several such accounts became an infinite render loop that froze the window. The selection now stays put, and the mail view explains that the mailbox has not synced and offers a Sync now button instead of asking for an account that already exists.
- Gmail API responses are now checked for a failure status before they are decoded. A Gmail error body is JSON, so it decoded cleanly into the same shapes as a success and every missing field fell back to a default — a refused request (Gmail API not enabled on the project, or an expired token) therefore looked like a mailbox that synced successfully and was permanently empty, and because the sync cursor never advanced it retried every 30 seconds indefinitely. The provider now reports the status and the API's own explanation.
- Google sign-in now asks for `access_type=offline` and `prompt=consent`. Google expresses offline access as an authorization parameter rather than a scope, so without `access_type=offline` a refresh token is not guaranteed and the account would silently fall back to one fixed access token that stops working after an hour. Without `prompt=consent`, re-authorizing an account can reuse the scope set of an existing grant instead of showing the full consent screen, which is how a Gmail account ends up holding a valid token that carries no Gmail permission at all — every Gmail API call is then refused with `403 insufficientPermissions` while the account looks healthy. Microsoft credentials are unaffected: they ask for `offline_access` as a scope, which is the equivalent mechanism.
- A refused Gmail request now reports the API's own reason instead of a truncated dump of the response body. Gmail pretty-prints its errors and puts `details[].reason` last, so the previous 400-character prefix cut off exactly the field that distinguishes a token with no Gmail scope (`ACCESS_TOKEN_SCOPE_INSUFFICIENT`) from a project that never enabled the Gmail API (`accessNotConfigured`) — two problems with completely different fixes.
- Search, Snoozed, and the Kanban board now honour the sidebar account selection. Previously these three views queried the whole local database, so messages from every account were mixed together regardless of which mailbox was selected. Results are now scoped to the active account (or left global when "All accounts" is selected) end to end — a Tantivy `account_id` filter for search, and a `message_id IN (SELECT id FROM messages WHERE account_id = ?)` subquery for snoozed messages and Kanban cards.
- Gmail API requests are now spaced apart so a sync can no longer exhaust the project's per-user query quota. Google meters `gmail.googleapis.com` at 6000 units per minute per user, and one `messages.get` together with any attachment bodies it pulls already costs roughly 30 of them, so a first sync used to spend the whole minute's budget in about 200 calls: the rest came back `403 RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, the account never completed a clean sync, and every folder except INBOX stayed empty. Every Gmail call — reads, writes and deletes alike — now goes out at most about 150 times a minute (≈4500 units), with one shared budget across all accounts. Set `PEBBLE_GMAIL_REQUEST_INTERVAL_MS` to tune the gap between calls, or to `0` to disable pacing entirely.
- Gmail folder sync now stores each message as soon as it is fetched instead of buffering the whole folder first. With requests paced to respect the query quota a large INBOX can now take minutes, and holding every body and attachment until the last one arrived kept the folder blank in the UI for that whole time while holding the entire folder in memory. Messages appear as they are fetched.
- "Trust sender" now actually changes what gets stripped. Both trust levels resolved to `LoadOnce` — the same mode the relaxed default already uses — and inside the sanitizer `PrivacyMode::TrustSender` was a plain alias of `LoadOnce`, so the address it carried was never read and trusting a sender could not be observed unless the default had been set to Strict. The two levels are now distinct: images-only trust still strips tracking pixels and known tracker domains and only lets remote images through, while full trust additionally lets those trackers load for that sender, which is what the privacy settings screen already claimed it did. External stylesheets remain blocked even for a fully trusted sender; only turning privacy off allows those.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Added OAuth2 token sign-in for manually configured IMAP accounts (XOAUTH2), required by Microsoft 365 now that basic authentication is disabled on IMAP. The refresh token is stored with the account and exchanged for a fresh access token before every connection. SMTP keeps using its own password, so one account can hold a token for receiving and a password for sending.

### Fixed

- Fixed the IMAP greeting being mistaken for a SASL continuation, which deadlocked the XOAUTH2 handshake until the command timed out.
- Fixed the XOAUTH2 authenticator not answering the server's failure challenge, which hid the real authentication error behind a timeout.
- Fixed `pebble-search` failing to build on stable Rust by replacing the nightly-only `str::floor_char_boundary`.
- Reduced the initial-sync batch from 200 messages to 50 so large mailboxes on slow links no longer exceed the 45s fetch timeout.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-09-09

### Added

- Added independent local account labels, visible alongside mailbox addresses, with v3 backup support and imports from v1/v2 backups (#79).
- Added OAuth mailbox verification and an in-place repair preview that preserves existing messages, user names, labels and account IDs (#78, #79).
- Added a one-time sender-name notice with a preview and a shortcut to account settings (#77).
- Added a local address book with searchable contacts, multiple labeled email addresses, favorites, notes, and quick create/edit actions from message participants (#81).
- Added recipient suggestions that prioritize saved contacts while retaining recent correspondents, with controls to suppress unwanted recent addresses (#81).
- Added standards-compatible vCard import and export with duplicate merging, partial-error reporting, UTF-8/folded-line support, and safe file/card limits (#81).
- Added contacts to local file and WebDAV settings backups, with backward-compatible imports (#81).

### Fixed

- Fixed partial Outlook sync updates clearing message subjects, bodies, metadata, and attachments after read or flag changes (#90).
- Fixed SMTP and Gmail dropping configured sender names. Structured From headers now support Unicode and punctuation, and outgoing retries preserve the stored sender identity (#77).
- Outlook now clearly shows its provider-managed sender name; changing a local label does not change the external identity. New OAuth accounts bind to a verified provider identity, and OAuth addresses cannot be changed through ordinary account editing (#77, #79).
- Settings restore preserves existing OAuth mailbox addresses and connected credentials instead of silently replacing them with another mailbox from a backup.
- Fixed copied-text feedback leaving a timer running after its popover was closed.
- Fixed vCard export/import losing whitespace at folded boundaries and treating carriage returns inside notes as new contact properties.
- Fixed participant actions associating a newly saved contact with an email address removed in the editor; recent-suggestion removal is now reachable by keyboard.
- Blocked queued SMTP sends after the account mailbox address changes, while retaining frozen names when only a name changes.
- OAuth remote drafts now use the same verified identity and connection as sending. Failed identity checks preserve encrypted local drafts without uploading them.
- Corrected backup restore feedback to explain that existing OAuth connections and mailboxes with local data are preserved.

### Upgrade notes

- Review existing sender names before sending: the old “Display name” setting is now included in SMTP/Gmail outgoing mail. Use the separate “Account label” for internal descriptions. Previously delivered messages are unchanged.
- Queued messages retain their original identity. Messages with missing or incompatible identities stop automatic retries and remain visible for review; unknown send outcomes are never automatically resent.
- Outlook sender names remain controlled by the mailbox service. This change does not enable aliases or delegated sending, and recipient address books may affect how names appear.
- New backups use schema v3. Upgrade other clients before importing them. Existing OAuth connections are preserved during restore; a new account can still restore its saved credentials. Settings backups do not include message bodies or attachments.
- Automated tests and package builds cover client behavior. Live SMTP/Gmail/Outlook recipient-side delivery has not been exercised for this release; provider rewriting and recipient address-book display remain outside the client guarantees. Verify your sender name with a test message before formal use.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Added custom and portable profile directories, including environment-variable, pointer-file, and executable-adjacent portable modes with profile-scoped frontend storage.
- Added CC recipient display and selectable IMAP sync folders; re-enabling a folder now backfills its complete message history (#74, #82).
- Added automatic compose subjects derived from the first attachment when the subject is otherwise empty.

### Changed

- Updated the desktop release metadata to version 0.1.4.
- Stored data-encryption keys in a keychain-safe hexadecimal format, with automatic migration and zeroization for legacy binary secrets (#22).
- Improved Linux AppImage startup by preferring Wayland when available while retaining X11 fallback, respecting explicit user configuration, and disabling binary stripping for release bundles.

### Fixed

- Fixed Outlook account setup so mailbox identity is resolved from Microsoft Graph without trusting incomplete local profile data.
- Hardened Gmail, Outlook, IMAP, and POP3 synchronization against UIDVALIDITY changes, stale cursors, pagination loops, attachment failures, duplicate provider IDs, and interrupted indexing or database commits.
- Made outgoing mail crash-safe by persisting the message, attachments, and send state before dispatch; uncertain outcomes are never retried automatically, API-provider placeholders are removed after confirmation, and SMTP copies move atomically to Sent.
- Made attachment downloads, draft replacement, trash deletion, and pending remote operations transactional and idempotent, including recovery after restarts and already-absent remote messages.
- Bound encrypted records to their storage identity with authenticated encryption, migrated legacy ciphertext safely, and prevented proxy, tracker, signature, template, and cloud-setting state from leaking across records or racing with user updates.
- Fixed compose attachment staging, autosave retries, Strict Mode lifecycle handling, rapid realtime preference changes, and several confirmation, selection, accessibility, and starred-message UI races.
- Hardened tagged release automation against unsafe tag interpolation, incomplete artifact sets, concurrent publication, and accidental overwrites of existing GitHub Releases.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Added an option to launch Pebble automatically when you sign in to your computer, under General settings → Startup Behavior (#64).
- Added a per-account option to allow unencrypted (plaintext) IMAP/SMTP connections for legacy servers that only support plaintext, shown as an explicit opt-in with a security warning when a connection's security is set to "None" (#70).

### Changed

- Updated the desktop release metadata to version 0.1.3.

### Fixed

- Fixed some email links being shown with a literal `&amp;` (for example in password-reset URLs) by no longer double-escaping ampersands when auto-linking plain-text URLs (#68).
- Fixed the account connection test reporting a false "passed" for accounts with a blank username: it now performs a real authenticated login, so authentication failures surface during testing instead of only after the account is added (#60).
- Fixed the startup window background color and title-bar theme so the window matches the active theme immediately on launch.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Updated the desktop release metadata to version 0.1.2.

### Fixed

- Fixed DeepL and DeepLX translation always failing with a `400 "source_lang not supported"` error by omitting the source language field when auto-detection is requested (#65).
- Fixed adding Outlook/Hotmail accounts: the username field is no longer required, and a blank username now defaults to the account email so app-password logins connect (#60).
- Prevented duplicate messages from appearing in the destination mailbox when a move operation is retried after a partial COPY/EXPUNGE failure.
- Prevented duplicate message rows from accumulating after a soft-delete followed by a re-sync, via a unique index on live `(account_id, remote_id)` rows.
- Prevented newly-arrived messages from being permanently missing from search results due to a race between the startup background reindex and concurrent sync.
- Preserved attachment filenames that were being altered on download and forwarding.
- Registered Pebble as the Windows mail client in the registry before opening the default-apps settings so "set as default" works reliably.
- Improved POP3 connectivity for legacy servers with a rustls→native-tls TLS backend fallback and optional TLS 1.0.
- Synced the native window background color with the active theme on macOS.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Added a tray preference to start Pebble hidden in the system tray at launch.
- Added native macOS traffic-light window controls in the title bar for a platform-idiomatic close/minimize/maximize experience.
- Added translation keyboard shortcuts, automatic settings backup, a default mail client preference, and a lightweight mode for the tray.
- Added local settings backup file export/import for cross-platform migration without WebDAV.
- Added optional encrypted WebDAV backup and restore for account passwords, OAuth tokens, and translation API keys.

### Changed

- Updated the desktop release metadata to version 0.1.1.

### Fixed

- Honored IMAP special-use folder attributes so the Trash, Sent, Drafts, Junk, and Archive flags reported by servers map to the expected local folders.
- Preserved email HTML container styles (such as `html`, `body`, and wrapper element rules) so sanitized messages keep their original layout.
- Stripped HTML and CSS from email preview snippets so list rows show clean plain-text previews instead of markup.
- Stopped retrying permanent authentication errors for pending mail operations, surfaced clearer status, and allowed dismissing failed operations from settings.
- Added missing English and Chinese translations for the new automatic backup, default mail client, and pending operations controls.
- Surfaced translation keyboard shortcuts in the settings page and fixed the wallpaper mode settings background rendering.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Added POP3 account support, including account setup, sync, provider dispatch, folder/message operations, and backup/restore metadata handling.
- Added an account-level option to allow invalid TLS certificates for IMAP and SMTP connections, including connection testing and settings UI support.

### Changed

- Updated the desktop release metadata to version 0.1.0.

### Fixed

- Recovered from invalid stored data-encryption keys by replacing malformed keyring entries instead of failing startup.
- Avoided repeated IMAP incremental fetches by checking UIDNEXT and searching for UIDs newer than the local cursor before fetching message bodies.
- Fixed TLS certificate policy localization in English and Chinese.
- Disabled WebKitGTK accelerated compositing for Linux AppImage launches when the user has not set `WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE`, working around Wayland/Hyprland repaint stalls where the UI only updates after resizing.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Added Pebble Web self-hosted edition information to the public site and README documentation.
- Added Arch Linux AUR installation instructions.

### Changed

- Expanded release automation to build and upload Windows, macOS, and Linux packages from tagged releases.
- Improved Linux package build handling and form focus-visible styling.

### Fixed

- Added `native-tls` fallback for IMAP TLS and STARTTLS connections when servers only offer DHE cipher suites unsupported by `rustls`, including `imap.sina.cn`.
- Improved email CSS rendering by preserving embedded styles in relaxed mode and allowing remote stylesheets in unrestricted or trusted-sender modes.
- Removed an overly strict home-directory check that could block attachment downloads.
- Hid the compose floating action button while reading message details.
- Fixed sidebar view switching so repeated navigation cannot get stuck on stale UI state.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- Added configurable custom background images with fit, contain, tile, and opacity controls.

### Fixed

- Displayed recipients in sent-mail message lists instead of showing the sender as the current account.
- Fixed Gmail history sync handling and modal backdrop behavior.
- Routed translation requests through the configured global proxy.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Added image paste support in the compose editor so clipboard images can be staged and sent as attachments.

### Fixed

- Updated Outlook local remote IDs after Graph API folder moves, including batch archive and delete paths, so follow-up actions no longer use stale message IDs.
- Enabled TLS 1.2 support for IMAP and SMTP connections to improve compatibility with older mail servers.
- Treated rustls unexpected EOF and missing TLS `close_notify` disconnects during IMAP polling as retryable connection interruptions.
- Improved IMAP compatibility for Tencent enterprise mail and other Coremail-based providers that require IMAP ID before login.
- Displayed the actual translate settings save and test error instead of a generic object string.
- Prevented modal dialogs from closing when text selection drags finish outside the window.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added the receiving account to the message detail header so all-account views show which mailbox received the selected email.

### Changed

- Polished the compose leave confirmation flow.
- Simplified unread row indicators while keeping unread messages visually distinct.

### Fixed

- Fixed notification clicks so they route directly to the target message.
- Improved mail sync reliability, including IMAP realtime polling fallback handling for empty Inbox baselines, UIDVALIDITY resets, same-count mailbox changes, sync failures, and local UID baselines.
- Refreshed folder unread counts immediately after read-state changes, message moves, batch actions, secondary message actions, command read changes, and sync completion events.
- Made unread message and thread rows more visible in dark mode.
- Preserved sanitized HTML email layouts and stabilized Shadow DOM rendering so full-height wrappers, gray canvases, and delayed layout jumps do not obscure message content.
- Preserved hidden email preheader clipping styles so preview text remains hidden instead of rendering as one character per line.
- Honored fully trusted senders in privacy rendering so trusted senders can load images and tracker resources according to the selected trust level.
- Stabilized the sidebar bottom navigation so Snoozed, Kanban, and Settings remain clickable when wide message content is visible.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Added `mailto:` deep-link support so email links can open Pebble compose with parsed recipients, subject, and body.
- Linkified plain-text URLs and email addresses in rendered message bodies.
- Added Linux AppImage packaging, Ubuntu CI package builds, tagged-release AppImage uploads, and Linux native credential storage support.

### Changed

- Improved desktop notification setup and status reporting, including Windows toast environment handling and development loading behavior.
- Refined the sidebar account selector width, alignment, and spacing.

### Fixed

- Fixed sending compose messages while contact recipient selection is still pending.
- Fixed opening links from rendered email bodies, including browser links and email-address links.
- Kept the new-notification red dot on the tray icon only.
- Clarified invalid WebDAV backup errors when a server returns an empty or HTML response instead of a Pebble backup file.
- Fixed CI issues that blocked Linux AppImage artifact generation.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Added global mail proxy settings for account connectivity.
- Added OAuth account proxy controls so Google and Microsoft account flows can use account-specific proxy settings.
- Added account color presets and automatic default colors for newly added accounts.
- Added account color markers in the all-accounts message list when multiple accounts are visible.
- Added first-launch language detection: Chinese system locales start in Chinese, and other locales start in English.

### Changed

- Reorganized proxy settings into clearer global and per-account sections.
- Refined the compose editor layout with a single compact toolbar, a full-height editor surface, and consistent rich text, Markdown, and HTML mode controls.
- Replies now open with a clean editable reply area while the original message is shown as a collapsed read-only quote; the quote is still appended when the reply is sent.
- Unified sidebar system folder ordering across all-accounts and single-account views so folders no longer jump when switching accounts.

### Fixed

- Persisted automatically assigned default account colors.
- Preserved existing account colors when restoring older WebDAV backups that do not contain color metadata.
- Fixed OAuth account editing so disabled/custom proxy mode is preserved correctly.
- Prevented account proxy settings from temporarily losing account metadata while settings are loading.
- Hid account color markers when a single account is selected or only one account exists.

### Documentation

- Documented the macOS quarantine workaround command `sudo xattr -cr` for users who need to run unsigned builds.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Added unsigned macOS app and DMG build scripts, current-platform desktop build routing, macOS CI packaging, and tagged release DMG artifact uploads.
- Added the macOS `.icns` bundle icon required by Tauri's macOS application bundle.

### Changed

- WebDAV restore now replaces local rules and Kanban cards/notes while merging account metadata from the backup, and restore previews disclose Kanban note counts.

### Fixed

- Enabled the native macOS Keychain backend for local credential encryption.
- Made search over subject, sender, and recipient short fields case-insensitive for Latin text, and trigger a search index rebuild for older case-sensitive indexes.
- Indexed locally saved sent and queued outgoing messages so they appear in search results.
- Moved compose drafts, templates, and signatures out of frontend `localStorage` and into encrypted backend secure storage.
- Protected in-progress compose content from being overwritten when account, signature, or language-dependent defaults change.
- Added retry scheduling, exponential backoff, and a maximum attempt limit for pending mail operations.
- Aligned offline batch mail operations with single-message optimistic local commit behavior.
- Staged compose attachments through the backend so valid selected files no longer depend on fragile frontend path handling.
- Moved Kanban context notes out of frontend `localStorage` and into encrypted backend secure storage, with one-time legacy note migration.
- Hardened HTML email CSS sanitization against escaped `url()` tokens that could trigger remote loads in strict privacy mode.
- Prevented duplicate same-account sync workers by keeping the startup placeholder lock alive until the real worker replaces it.
- Report realtime restart failures back to the UI instead of silently accepting preference changes after all or part of sync restart failed.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Added tray and background-running controls so Pebble can close to the system tray, restore from the tray menu, and keep the close-to-background preference in app state.
- Added localized tray menu labels and status bar copy for background sync behavior.
- Added public privacy policy and terms of service pages for Google OAuth app verification.
- Added English and Chinese language switching for the privacy policy and terms pages.
- Added Cloudflare Workers site deployment configuration for the public site.
- Added the LINUX DO friend link to the English and Chinese README files.

### Changed

- Themed native form controls and focus-visible styling so inputs, selects, textareas, and buttons fit the dark UI.

### Fixed

- Improved attachment download reliability by saving duplicate target filenames with a unique suffix instead of failing.
- Staged local draft, outbox, and sent-message attachments into Pebble's app data directory so downloads no longer depend on the original selected file path.
- Persisted IMAP attachments before notifying the frontend about newly synced messages.
- Refined Gmail attachment parsing so large body parts are not shown as attachments and inline content-ID images stay out of the download list.
- Added clearer attachment download failure messages and backend download logging.
- Fixed the Cloudflare Worker site target and migrated the site config to the JSONC Workers format.
