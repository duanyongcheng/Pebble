//! Every launch used to place the main window at the size and position written
//! in `tauri.conf.json` — 1200×800, centred — so anyone who works with a second
//! display moved it back into place by hand at every start. The geometry is now
//! written beside the rest of the profile once the window has held still for a
//! moment, and applied again before the window is first shown.
//!
//! Restoring it blindly would not be safe. A position only means something
//! relative to a display that was attached at the time, and this machine's
//! external monitor drops out on its own; a rectangle that no longer overlaps
//! any attached display is therefore discarded, which leaves the centred
//! default in place — a window nobody can reach is worse than a window in the
//! wrong corner.
